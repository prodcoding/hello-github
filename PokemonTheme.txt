I want to be the very best
Like no one ever was
To catch them is my real test
To train them is my cause
I will travel accross the land
Searching far and wide
For each pokemon to understand
The power that's inside
Pokemon gotta catch em all (It's you and me)
I know it's my destiny

I stand tall cause I know I'm a winner
Knock me down ill just get up again
you ve met your match yeah im no beginner
pokemon, pokemon gotta catch em all
